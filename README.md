Planar data classification with one hidden layer

In this notebook we will generate red and blue points to form a flower. 

we will then fit a neural network to correctly classify the points. we will try different layers and see the results.


Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.

Recognize that the more hidden layers we have the more complex structure we could capture.

Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.
